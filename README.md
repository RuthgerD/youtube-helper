# youtube-dl-helper

download.sh & .bat uses youtube-dl to download the videos specified in song.txt (downloads each newline)


main.py tries to extract title and artist info from the filename and applies it with kid3-clu
you can pass it a directory or else it will use the current directory
needs kid3-cli systemwide so it prob doesnt support windows .exe atm hihi
